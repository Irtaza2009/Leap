# Sacrificial Leap

A game where you have to make sacrifices to win!

**Play at:** https://irtaza.itch.io/sacrificial-leap

A minimalist platformer created for **Daydream Islamabad** _(a 2-day irl in-person game jam)_, based on the theme _Sacrifices Need to Be Made_!

You play as a brave little square who must overcome spikes, gaps, and obstacles.
But some challenges can’t be solved by jumping alone…

To progress, you must sacrifice yourself, spawning a smaller square that continues the journey. Each sacrifice makes you weaker but allows you to overcome greater dangers. Use your 2–3 sacrifices wisely — once they’re gone, so are your chances.

**Features:**

- Tight platforming controls.
- Unique sacrifice mechanic: spawn a smaller self at the cost of your current body.
- Spikes, jumps, and level exits to challenge your timing.
- Sound effects for jumping, dying, sacrificing, and winning.
- Background music that loops across levels.
- Simple visuals, but deeper strategy: when will you sacrifice?

**Controls:**

- ​A/D or Right/Left arrow keys for movement.
- W or Up arrow key for jumping
- Space to sacrifice and launch a smaller square.
